Hi! I am postdoctoral scholar in the [WiSeCom](https://www.upf.edu/web/wisecom) group at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu), Spain, supervised by [Prof. Angel Lozano](https://www.upf.edu/web/angel-lozano). Before that, I was a postdoctoral scholar with [Prof. Thomas Marzetta](https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/thomas-marzetta/) for two years in the [NYU Wireless](https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu) group at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu), USA. I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it), Italy, under the supervision of [Prof. Luca Sanguinetti](https://people.unipi.it/luca_sanguinetti/). 

My research focuses on the theoretical understanding of physical-layer wireless communications using tools borrowed from multiple disciplines such as communication theory, electromagnetism, statistical signal processing, and information theory.
