Hi! I am postdoctoral scholar in the [WiSeCom](https://www.upf.edu/web/wisecom) group at [Universitat+Pompeu+Fabra] (https://www.upf.edu), Barcelona, supervised by [Prof. Angel Lozano] (https://www.upf.edu/web/angel-lozano). Before that, I was a postdoctoral scholar with [Prof. Thomas Marzetta] (https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/thomas-marzetta/) for two years in the [NYU Wireless] (https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu) group at New York University (https://engineering.nyu.edu), USA. I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering at the [University of Pisa] (https://www.unipi.it), Italy, under the supervision of [Prof. Luca Sanguinetti] (https://people.unipi.it/luca_sanguinetti/). 

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
